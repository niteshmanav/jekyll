  It's hard choosing a CMS. The main criteria I had was that I wanted all the
  content stored on the Github account. Markdown in one folder, photos in
  another. This means you don't even need the CMS — you can just go in there and
  edit the files! Most other CMS are much more complicated than this, like the
  Ghost CMS system, or Contentful, which is really popular but $40 a month.

Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
